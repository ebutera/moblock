       hyakki for suggestions and testing!)
     - included patches from Maximilian Mehnert to support log file
       rotation, creation of pid file, fixes and files for debian
       packaging and new start script supporting ports whitelisting

---

0.7: - loaded ranges are now automatically merged when overlapping
       or already included ranges are found (guarding.p2p files
       usually have many of these)
     - added command line option -q to specify queue number (only
       when using NFQUEUE interface), must match iptables
       --queue-num option. Defaults to 0 if not specified
     - on startup prints used options and ranges stats
     - better handling of command line options
     - fix string handling bug

       (from kernel 2.6.14)
     - blocklist can be reloaded on runtime sending
       HUP signal (kill -HUP pid)

---

0.4: - can now use new peerguardian 2.x lists ( .pdb files ) and
       ipfilter.dat, see README
     - minor random fixes

---

0.3: - added patches for regex blocklist loading, command line args and
       Makefile from Andrew de Quincey ( adq at lidskialf dot net )
     - Updated README and start script, now you can start it with
	./MoBlock.sh &
       by default it will load the block list from /etc/guarding.p2p and
       will log to ./MoBlock.log
       Edit the start script if you want to use other files.
     - Stats always written on /var/log/MoBlock.stats on exit
